# Presentation Frameworks

## Framework 1: Situation - Complication - Resolution

- **Situation:** Functions as a starting point and a common basis. Therefore it primarily contains recognizable and agreed points.
- **Complication:** Spells the real reason for acting now. It contains threats/opportunities and the hurdles that need to be overcome.
- **Resolution:** Provides the answer on how to overcome the hurdles. Explains how this will help deflect the threats or seize the opportunities.

## Framework 2: Hook – Message – Proof – Close

### HOOK → Get attention. Create relevance.
**Goal:** Interrupt autopilot. Get them to care.

**Tools:**
- A surprising stat or fact
- A provocative question
- A pain point or emotional trigger
- A bold visual or demo

**Psychology:** Leverages curiosity bias and relevance framing

**Example:** "82% of customer complaints are about things the product team already knew—but didn't prioritize."

### MESSAGE → Deliver your big idea. Clearly.
**Goal:** Land the one idea you want them to remember.

**Tools:**
- Crisp, confident language (10–15 words max)
- Framing around value or impact
- No fluff or multiple ideas

**Psychology:** Anchors the audience's mental model for what's coming

**Example:** "We built AI Call Coach to turn every rep into your best rep—in real time."

### PROOF → Show it's real. Build credibility.
**Goal:** Eliminate doubt, provide substance, build trust.

**Tools:**
- Data points ("80% adoption in 2 weeks")
- Quotes or testimonials
- Screenshots, mockups, demos
- Case studies or analogies

**Psychology:** Validates the message through logic and social proof

**Example:** "After rollout, we saw a 35% increase in CSAT and a 40% drop in onboarding time."

### CLOSE → End with impact. Drive action.
**Goal:** Seal the deal—whether that's inspiration or a decision.

**Tools:**
- Call to action ("Let's roll this out to the enterprise org.")
- Vision close ("This is how we build the smartest support team in the industry.")
- Next step ("We're scheduling pilots this week. I'll follow up with a form.")

**Psychology:** Leverages recency bias—what you say last lingers

**Example:** "We're ready to scale this to all regions by end of Q3. Let's lock in support today."

## Framework 3: Start with Why

### WHY – Start with Purpose
**What it is:** The belief, cause, or purpose that drives you.

**Why it matters:** It taps into the emotional core and builds trust.

**Example questions to answer:**
- Why does your team exist?
- What bigger mission is this work a part of?
- Why does this matter to your audience?

**Cognitive Effect:** Engages emotional decision-making (limbic brain), driving trust and connection.

### HOW – Explain the Approach
**What it is:** The unique methods, values, or processes you use.

**Why it matters:** Differentiates you from others doing similar things.

**Example questions:**
- What principles guide our work?
- How do we solve problems differently?
- What's our special sauce?

**Cognitive Effect:** Builds credibility and explains the means behind the mission.

### WHAT – Show the Result
**What it is:** The product, feature, deliverable, or outcome.

**Why it matters:** People need to see the output to anchor the inspiration.

**Example questions:**
- What exactly are we building or launching?
- What can users or customers see and interact with?
- What measurable result are we after?

**Cognitive Effect:** Gives concrete evidence of execution, reinforcing trust and value.
